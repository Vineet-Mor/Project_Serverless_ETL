# Project_Serverless_ETL
To design and implement a serverless ETL pipeline that extracts data from an on-premise database, transforms it, and loads it into Google BigQuery for further analysis. The pipeline will use Google Cloud Functions to handle the ETL processes in a scalable and efficient manner.

Key Components
1. Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
2. Google Cloud Functions
3. Google BigQuery
4. Cloud Scheduler
5. Pub/Sub
6. IAM for security and permissions

Workflow Steps:

1. Project Initiation:
   -Objectives: Automate the ETL process to ensure timely and accurate data loading into BigQuery.
   -Stakeholders: Data engineers, data analysts, data scientists, project managers.
   
2. Set Up Google Cloud Environment
   -Create a Google Cloud Project: Set up a new project in Google Cloud.
   -Required APIs: Enable Cloud Functions, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Pub/Sub, and Cloud Scheduler APIs.
   -IAM Roles: Define and assign roles for different team members to ensure proper access control.
   
3. Data Extraction
   -Trigger: Detect changes in the on-premise database or schedule regular data extracts.
   -Action: Extract data from the on-premise system and upload it to a GCS bucket.
   -Cloud Function:
        *Function 1: extract_data_to_gcs
        *Trigger: Cloud Scheduler
        *Action: Connect to the on-premise database, extract data, and upload it to GCS.
   
4. Data Transformation:
    -Trigger: New file uploaded to GCS.
    -Action: Transform the data according to business requirements.
    -Cloud Function:
        *Function 2: transform_data
        *Trigger: GCS Object Finalize event
        *Action: Read the uploaded file, perform transformations, and save the transformed data back to GCS or load it directly into BigQuery.

5. Data Loading:
    -Trigger: Transformed data ready in GCS.
    -Action: Load the transformed data into BigQuery.
    -Cloud Function:
        *Function 3: load_data_to_bigquery
        *Trigger: GCS Object Finalize event or Pub/Sub
        *Action: Load the data from GCS into BigQuery.

6. Data Governance and Security:
    -Implement IAM Policies: Control access to Cloud Functions, GCS, and BigQuery.
    -Enable Encryption: Ensure data is encrypted at rest and in transit.
    -Set Up Logging and Monitoring: Use Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring for visibility and alerting.

7. Monitoring and Error Handling:
    -Cloud Function:
        *Function 4: monitor_etl_pipeline
        *Trigger: Cloud Monitoring alerts or Pub/Sub
        *Action: Monitor the ETL process, send alerts on failure, and implement retry mechanisms.
   
8. Scheduling and Automation
    -Use Cloud Scheduler: Automate the initiation of the ETL process at specified intervals.
    -Setup Cloud Scheduler: Configure it to trigger the extract_data_to_gcs function.

9. Documentation and Metadata Management
    -Document ETL Workflows: Include data schemas, transformation logic, and error handling processes.
    -Use Cloud Data Catalog: Manage metadata and enable data discovery.
   
10. Performance Optimization
    -Optimize Cloud Functions: Ensure functions are performant and scalable.
    -Optimize BigQuery: Use partitioning and clustering for efficient querying.
